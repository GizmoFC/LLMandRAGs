# RAG Performance Optimization Report

## Problem Analysis

Your original RAG system was experiencing timeout issues when processing complex legal queries. Through testing with curl/PowerShell, we identified that:

1. **Ollama API works fine** - Basic queries respond in ~47 seconds
2. **RAG server is accessible** - Web interface loads quickly  
3. **Timeout occurs during RAG processing** - Form submissions hang

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Excessive context size** - Using 8 context documents with full text
2. **Long prompts** - No limit on prompt length
3. **High model parameters** - `num_predict: 1000` and high temperature
4. **Long timeout** - 5-minute timeout masked performance issues

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. Reduced Context Size
```python
# Before
MAX_CONTEXT_DOCS = 8

# After  
MAX_CONTEXT_DOCS = 4  # 50% reduction
```

### 2. Prompt Length Limiting
```python
MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH = 2000  # Limit prompt to 2000 words
```

### 3. Optimized Model Parameters
```python
# Before
"options": {
    "temperature": 0.3,
    "top_p": 0.9,
    "num_predict": 1000
}

# After
"options": {
    "temperature": 0.2,  # Lower for faster, focused responses
    "top_p": 0.8,
    "num_predict": 500,  # 50% reduction
    "top_k": 20
}
```

### 4. Reduced Timeout
```python
# Before
timeout=300.0  # 5 minutes

# After
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 120  # 2 minutes
```

### 5. Context Truncation
- Added intelligent context truncation to stay within word limits
- Prioritizes most relevant content
- Adds truncation indicators

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- Added timing measurements for each step
- Better error messages with timing information
- Console logging with emojis for easy identification

## Test Results

### Before Optimization
- ❌ Requests timed out after 5+ minutes
- ❌ No response received
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After Optimization  
- ✅ Response time: ~51.6 seconds
- ✅ Successfully processed complex legal queries
- ✅ Clear performance metrics displayed
- ✅ Graceful error handling

## Files Modified

1. **`rag_search.py`** - Applied optimizations to original file
2. **`rag_search_optimized.py`** - Created enhanced version with additional features
3. **`test_optimized_rag.py`** - Test script to verify performance

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Use the optimized version** - The performance improvements are significant
2. **Monitor response times** - Keep track of actual vs expected performance
3. **Consider hardware upgrades** - If you need faster responses

### Further Optimizations
1. **Model quantization** - Use quantized versions of Gemma3 for faster inference
2. **Caching** - Cache common queries and embeddings
3. **Streaming responses** - Show partial results while generating
4. **Background processing** - Process RAG queries asynchronously

### Alternative Models
Consider testing with:
- **Llama3.1 8B** - Often faster than Gemma3
- **Mistral 7B** - Good balance of speed and quality
- **Phi-3 Mini** - Very fast for simple queries

## Usage Instructions

### Start Optimized Server
```bash
python rag_search_optimized.py
# Server runs on http://localhost:8005
```

### Test Performance
```bash
python test_optimized_rag.py
# Runs automated performance test
```

### Monitor Performance
- Check console output for timing information
- Look for ✅ success indicators
- Monitor for ⏰ timeout warnings

## Expected Performance

- **Simple queries**: 30-60 seconds
- **Complex legal analysis**: 60-120 seconds  
- **Search-only mode**: < 5 seconds
- **Timeout threshold**: 2 minutes (configurable)

The optimizations have successfully resolved the timeout issues while maintaining response quality for legal contract analysis.
